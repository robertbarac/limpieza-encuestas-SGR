# Surveys cleaning SGR project

Basically, I took many physical surveys (around the 500) of 3 diferent populations exposed to inorganic and organic pollutants. to type them into a Excel document, along aproximately 10 sheets.
Then, I cleaned and preprocesed the data to make some graphics about demographic information.
